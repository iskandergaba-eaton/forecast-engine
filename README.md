# Power Consumption Forecast Engine

## Running Experiments
If you want to run experiments, you will first need to download a snapshot of clean data from [here](https://eaton-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/iskandergaba/ErcotJGQi3BMsGSD2TbOGoMB9iC5OFQ1O2bQVexgUcq9Fw?e=SHx2jY) and place it at the same level of the repository. For example, if the repository is in `path/src`, the data folder should be in `path/data` so that both `data` and `code` are in two separate folders under the same parent. You can then run any of the `*-ex.py` experiment Python files under `experiments` folder. You can also skip to viewing the results and plots resulting from these experiments directly by checking this shared [folder](https://eaton-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/iskandergaba/EhOcHBZrzlRJnUnbxBdp-AYBD44DVdggl4BRV9NMwmXPwQ?e=fM1DyH).

# Power Consumption: Data Cleaning

This repository contains cleaning script used to clean the data retrieved from the VM collecting the ESX/ESXi hosts metrics from the datacenters in EU and USA.
